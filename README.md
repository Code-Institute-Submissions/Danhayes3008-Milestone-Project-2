Git hub update:

There was a slight problem at the begining of this project with github refusing to accept my push commands due to deleting a file i added by mistake.
this was fixed by deleting the repository on github website and starting it again. Luckly all updates i originaly did were re added with the time stamps 
and comments that i used when i pushed them to github.

contrabutions:

I received help from joWings on the slack chat room with regards to the reset element that allows me to reset all charts and the select menu.
She also helped me improve on the reset button so that i wouldnt have problems thurther down the road when i start using Jquery.

Marie O on slack chat room helped me by viewing the dashboard and giving some feedback back about the ux. she has suggested the
following changes to imrove the site:

. change the footer background colour

. remove the types of charts from the chart title

. add thicker font onto x-axis column names as there hard to read

. needed to add caps to the country of origin title

. remove the ' from page title

. add more colours to the charts instead of just different shades of green

. add currency denomination to the total spend

. total visited need to be more clearer as she didnt know what that was for.

found an awnser to a problem on git hub. <a href="https://github.com/KoenDeMol">KoenDeMol</a> responded to someone who had the same problem giving
at solution which was to add ._rangeBandPadding(1) into the chart coding
